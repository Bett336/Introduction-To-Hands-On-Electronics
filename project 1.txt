# this is my first project with techtenum

# it is a simple design of an network circuit

# it innvolves measurements and calculation of values

# these values include and in order: resistances, currents, voltages at various nodes

# option 1. Simulations at https://falstad.com

# option 2. KCL KVL hands on calculation on paper

# followed by circuit design on breadbord, and respsctive 5V sourced from Arduino Uno R3 board

# currents can then be measured by use of a digital multimeter
