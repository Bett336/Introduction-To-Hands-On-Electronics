# This is my first project with techtenum

# It is a simple design of an network circuit

# It innvolves measurements and calculation of values

# These values include and in order: resistances, currents, voltages at various nodes

# Option 1. Simulations at https://falstad.com

# Option 2. KCL KVL hands on calculation on paper

# followed by circuit design on breadbord, and respective 5V sourced from Arduino Uno R3 board

# Currents can then be measured by use of a digital multimeter

# TENUM KIT V 1.0 USED
